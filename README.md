## The Glasses UI 
Glasses UI is a UI library developed with the Angular framework with open source code. The difference from other UI libraries is that you can shape your HTML code in a class like you write CSS to the classes inside any HTML tag.
So how do you get started? Take a look at our [getting started guide](/getting-started) to understand how it works, and proceed from there.
