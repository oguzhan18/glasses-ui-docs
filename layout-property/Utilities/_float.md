# How to use the Float?

This feature creates classes that contain certain `"float"` values ​​(left, right, none). These classes are used to
control the behavior of elements.

## Usage Method

Below is an HTML sample showing how to use this `feature`:

```html

<div class="gls-container">
    <div class="float-left">This content moves to the left.</div>
    <div class="float-right">This content moves to the right.</div>
    <div class="float-none">This content does not go anywhere, it stays in the normal stream.</div>
</div>
````

> `.float-left`: This class is used to float content to the left edge. Content is displayed to the right of other
> content, justified to the left.<br>
> `.float-right:` This class is used to float content to the right edge. Content is displayed to the left of other
> content, justified to the right.<br>
> `.float-none:` This class ensures that the content does not float. The content stays in the normal flow and is lined
> up with other content in an ordinary way.

The SCSS code and HTML usage example above will help you create useful classes that you can use to arrange your content
as if it were floating or not floating on the page. This method allows you to position the contents in different
directions and helps you customize the layout of the page.
